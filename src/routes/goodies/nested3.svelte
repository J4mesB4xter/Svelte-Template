Welcome to StrexCorp!<br><br>

As a new {job}, you will be evaluated for personal {category_of_measurement} and {emotion}.
Based on your own {category_of_measurement} you will receive daily {noun} reviews. Remember to always
{verb} yourself to others, because if you fail to meet the standard of joy and {category_of_measurement}
your coworkers do, you could be {adverb1}, {adverb2}, and {adverb3} {scary_verbed}.<br><br>

Your {important_noun} ending will also mark the end of your job here at StrexCorp, so be careful not 
to die, since your life has no meaning or {emotion} outside of your {category_of_measurement} here at StrexCorp. <br><br>

{thing1} to your {thing2},<br>
{adjecting} god <br>
CEO
